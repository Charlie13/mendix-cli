Documentation: "Clones objects, their associations and even referred objects. \r\n\r\n-
  Source: the original object to copy\r\n- Target: the object to copy it into (should
  be of the same type, or a specialization)\r\n- MembersToSkip: members which should
  not  be set at all\r\n- MembersToKeep: references which should be set, but not cloned.
  (so source and target will refer to exactly the same object). If an association
  is not part of this property, it will be cloned.\r\n- ReverseAssociations: 1 - 0
  assications which refer to target, which will be cloned as well. Only the reference
  name itself needs to be mentioned.\r\n- excludeEntities: entities that will not
  be cloned. references to these entities will refer to the same object as the source
  did.\r\n- excludeModules: modules that will have none of their enities cloned. Behaves
  similar to excludeEntities.\r\n\r\nmembers format: <membername> or <module.association>
  or <module.objecttype/membername>, where objecttype is the concrete type of the
  object being cloned. \r\n\r\nreverseAssociation: \r\n<module.relation>\r\n\r\nmembersToSkip
  by automatically contains createdDate and changedDate. \r\nmembersToKeep by automatically
  contains System.owner and System.changedBy\r\n\r\nNote that DeepClone does commit
  all objects, where Clone does not."
