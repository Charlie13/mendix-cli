$Type: JavaActions$JavaAction
ActionDefaultReturnName: ReturnValueName
Documentation: "Runs a microflow asynchronous, that is, this action immediately returns
  but schedules the microflow to be run in the near future. The queue guarantees a
  first come first serve order of the microflows, and only one action is served at
  a time.\r\n\r\nThe microflow is run with system rights in its own transaction, and
  is very useful to run heavy microflows on the background."
