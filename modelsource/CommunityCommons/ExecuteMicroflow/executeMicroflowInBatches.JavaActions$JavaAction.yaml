$Type: JavaActions$JavaAction
ActionDefaultReturnName: ReturnValueName
Documentation: "Invokes a microflow in batches. The microflow is invoked for each
  individual item returned by the xpath query. \r\n\r\nThe objects will be processed
  in small batches (based on the batchsize), which makes this function very useful
  to process large amounts of objects without using much memory. All defaut behavior
  such as commit events are applied as defined in your microflow. \r\n\r\nParameters:\r\n-
  xpath: Fully qualified xpath query that indicates the set of objects the microflow
  should be invoked on. For example:\r\n'//System.User[Active = true()]'\r\n- microflow:
  The microflow that should be invoked. Should accept one argument of the same type
  as the xpath. For example:\r\n'MyFirstModule.UpdateBirthday'\r\n- batchsize: The
  amount of objects that should be processed in a single transaction. When in doubt,
  1 is fine, but larger batches (for example; 100) will be faster due to less overhead.\r\n-
  waitUntilFinished: Whether this call should block (wait) until all objects are\r\n
  processed.\r\n\r\nReturns true if the batch has successfully started, or, if waitUntilFinished
  is true, returns true if the batch succeeded completely. \r\n\r\nNote, if new objects
  are added to the dataset while the batch is still running, those objects will be
  processed as well."
