ActionDefaultReturnName: ReturnValueName
Documentation: "Returns the Cloud Foundry Instance Index that is set during deployment
  of the application in a Cloud native environment. Based on the Cloud Foundry Instance
  Index, Mendix determines what is the leader instance (index 0 executes scheduled
  events, db sync, session management etc.) or slave instance.\r\n\r\nReturns 0 for
  the leader instance, 1 or higher for slave instances or -1 when the environment
  variable could not be read (when running locally or on premise). When -1 is returned,
  it will probably be the leader in the cluster.\r\n\r\nMake sure emulate cloud security
  is disabled. Otherwise, the policy restrictions will prevent the method to be executed.
  Action is tested in Mendix Cloud on 19-12-2018."
