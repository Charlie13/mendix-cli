Documentation: "(Behavior has changed since version 3.2. The exception is now properly
  propagated to the cient). \r\n\r\nThrows an exception.  This is very useful if the
  microflow is called by a webservice. If you throw this kind of exceptions, an fault
  message will be generated in the output, instead of an '501 Internal server' error.\r\n\r\nIf
  debug level of community commons is set to 'debug' the errors will be locally visible
  as well, otherwise not. Throwing a webservice exception states that the webservice
  invocation was incorrect, not the webservice implementation."
